<h3 id="user-accounts-and-account-security" >3. User Accounts and Account Security</h3>

<p>You may need to register for an SurfGenie account with SurfGenie or a payment account with SurfGenie's Payment Provider (see section 4(C) for more information) to access some or all of our Services. If you register for any account in connection with the Services, you must provide accurate account information and promptly update this information if it changes. You also must maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials, and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your account without your permission. Additionally, you may only register for an SurfGenie account if you are legally permitted to, and do, live in the United States or one of its territories.

<h3 id="the-SurfGenie-services" >4. The SurfGenie Services</h3>

<h4>A. Posting Items</h4>

<p>The SurfGenie Services allow you to post items for sale by uploading pictures and providing item descriptions. You can post most items through the Services without charge. SurfGenie charges a fee to post some items or if you exceed your available free posts for certain types of items. If there is a fee to post your item, SurfGenie will notify you through the Services before you post your item. You may also promote your items for a fee. If you pay to promote your item, SurfGenie will post your item more prominently and frequently within the Services home feed. Promoted items are also identified within the feed. SurfGenie offers various pricing packages, including subscriptions, to post and promote items. Pricing details are provided through the SurfGenie Services.</p>

<h4>B. Buying and Selling</h4>

<p>When a buyer and seller agree on a price for an item posted for sale on the Services, they have different options for completing the transaction.</p>

<p>If a buyer and seller agree, items may be paid for outside of the SurfGenie Services, such as by cash, check or other payment method agreed upon. Such payments are made directly between the buyer and the seller when they complete their transaction, pursuant to terms they determine. SurfGenie is not a party to such transactions, does not facilitate such transactions, and cannot assist with refunds or returns related to such transactions in any manner.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the SurfGenie Services allow you to pay for a purchase with a credit card or other electronic payment method through the Services ("<em>SurfGenie Payment Solution</em>"). Some transactions, such as purchases from Pro Sellers, may only be made using the SurfGenie Payment Solution. All purchases made using the SurfGenie Payment Solution are made directly between you and the other party according to these Terms and any other terms the parties mutually determine. SurfGenie is not a party to such transactions and disclaims any and all responsibility to facilitate such transactions or provide refunds or returns, other than as expressly provided in the <a href="https://SurfGenie.com/support/?return_to=/360032329891" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Purchase Protection Policies</a>.</p>

<h4>C. Payment Accounts</h4>

<p>If you choose to make or accept payment for items using the SurfGenie Payment Solution, you agree to pay the relevant service fees. SurfGenie reserves the right to change the service fees from time to time.</p>

<p>Making or accepting payment using the SurfGenie Payment Solution requires you maintain an account with SurfGenie's then-current payment processor for the SurfGenie Payment Solution ("<em>Payment Provider</em>"). SurfGenie currently uses Stripe, Inc. ("<em>Stripe</em>"), a payment processing service, as its Payment Provider. If you wish to use this feature, you must enroll for the service through Stripe. By enrolling, you enter into an agreement with Stripe subject to the terms of the <a href="https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><u>Stripe Connected Account Agreement</u></a>, which includes the <a href="https://stripe.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><u >Stripe Terms of Service</u></a> (collectively, the "<em>Stripe Services Agreement</em>"). SurfGenie is not a party to the Stripe Services Agreement and is not responsible for the payment services provided by Stripe. If Stripe discontinues providing services in connection with the SurfGenie Payment Solution, you authorize Stripe to share your payment method information with an alternative Payment Provider.</p>

<p>SurfGenie, in its sole discretion, may from time to time impose limits on your ability to make and/or receive payments through the SurfGenie Payment Solution. Additionally, the Payment Provider may impose its own limits on your use of the SurfGenie Payment Solution. THE PAYMENT PROVIDER MUST ACCEPT YOUR APPLICATION TO USE THE SurfGenie PAYMENT SOLUTION BEFORE YOU CAN RECEIVE SALES PROCEEDS VIA THE SurfGenie PAYMENT SOLUTION. IF THE PAYMENT PROVIDER REJECTS YOUR APPLICATION OR YOU FAIL TO SET UP A PAYMENT PROVIDER ACCOUNT WITHIN 90 DAYS AFTER COMPLETION OF A SALE PROCESSED THROUGH THE SurfGenie PAYMENT SOLUTION, THEN THE PAYMENT PROVIDER MAY DISABLE OR LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SALES PROCEEDS VIA THE SurfGenie PAYMENT SOLUTION.</p>

<p>YOUR RIGHT AND/OR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SALES PROCEEDS VIA THE SurfGenie PAYMENT SOLUTION MAY BE REVOKED, DISABLED, OR LIMITED IF THE PURCHASE OR SALE VIOLATES ANY OF THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THE PROHIBITED ITEMS GUIDELINES REFERENCED IN SECTION 7.</p>

<p>The buyer's payment, minus any applicable SurfGenie fee, will be released to the seller typically 3-5 business days after the purchased item has been delivered to the buyer, provided that no claims are made by the buyer under the <a href="https://SurfGenie.com/support/?return_to=/360032329891" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Purchase Protection Policies</a>. Purchase Protection claims may result in delay and/or cancellation of payment being released to the seller. Sellers authorize the Payment Provider to pay SurfGenie from Seller's account any fees incurred by the Seller from using the Services.</p>

<h4>D. Taxes</h4>

<p>You are responsible for any sales, use, duty, or other governmental taxes or fees due with respect to your purchase or sale through the Services.</p>

<p>SurfGenie will collect applicable sales tax if we determine that we have a duty to collect sales tax in a given state. SurfGenie maintains a <a href="https://SurfGenie.com/support/?return_to=/360032329751" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" >list of the states</a> where it collects sales tax. If you are in a state where SurfGenie does not collect sales tax on your behalf, you are required to collect all applicable sales taxes for sales made through the SurfGenie Services.</p>

<p>SurfGenie may need to report your earnings from SurfGenie transactions to tax authorities if you hit certain thresholds of activity on our platform. If SurfGenie determines that it is necessary to report your earnings, we will ask you for personal information, such as your social security number, in order to complete tax form 1099-K. If you do not provide this information when requested, we will instruct our Payment Provider to block payments to your bank account until we receive the necessary information.</p>

<h4>E. Shipping</h4>

<p>SurfGenie permits sellers to post certain items as being available for shipping nationwide (within the contiguous United States).</p>

<p>Sellers who post items as being available for shipping nationwide must ship their items in accordance with SurfGenie's <a href="https://SurfGenie.com/support/?return_to=/360039017352" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Shipping Policy</a>. When a seller accepts a buyer's offer to purchase an item to be shipped, the seller must print the pre-paid shipping label provided by SurfGenie and mail the item within 3 business days of accepting the offer. Sellers who receive a pre-paid shipping label are charged a fee for sales that results in an item being shipped. The seller may cancel an accepted offer up until the package is initially scanned for mailing.</p>

<p>Buyers who have requested items be shipped to them pay for the cost of shipping items. When a seller accepts a buyer's offer to purchase an item and have it shipped to them, SurfGenie will charge or put a hold on the buyer's method of payment, pending delivery of the item. Buyers can cancel an offer to purchase an item for shipping up until the seller has accepted the offer.</p>

<p>SurfGenie is not a party to transactions conducted between buyers and sellers, or to the shipping of items from sellers to buyers, and, other than as expressly provided in the <a href="https://SurfGenie.com/support/?return_to=/360039017352" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Shipping Policy</a>, SurfGenie is not liable for any losses, damages, or delays related to shipping.</p>

<p>You agree not to use the SurfGenie shipping service in a manner that violates the law and/or United States Postal Service or shipping regulations, including but not limited to U.S. Postal Service Publication 52. Without limiting the forgoing, you may not ship any item that contains weapons, ammunition, explosives, living or infectious biological matter, human remains, pornography, alcohol, prescription drugs, illegal drugs, currency, dangerous goods, hazardous goods, or other goods that may not be shipped or mailed by law. Anyone who ships a prohibited, illegal, or improperly packaged or labeled material is subject to legal penalties such as civil penalties, fines and/or imprisonment, including but not limited to those specified in 18 U.S.C. § 1716 and 39 U.S.C. § 3018.</p>

<h3 id="truyou-feature" >5. TruYou Feature</h3>

<p>SurfGenie allows you to apply for certain badges that are associated with your SurfGenie account. One badge we offer is the TruYou badge. The TruYou badge is given to users who provide a form of valid self identification. We partner with Onfido, a third party service, to process TruYou applications. To receive the TruYou badge, users must provide certain personal identification documents (e.g., a driver's license). If you request the TruYou badge, you represent and warrant that (a) any personal identification document that you provide to us is an unaltered and accurate image of your government-issued personal identification document, and (b) that you have all necessary permissions to provide the personal identification documents to us and your provision of the personal identification documents to us does not violate any law or regulation or cause us to be subject to any investigation, prosecution or legal action. DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE IF THE FOREGOING IS NOT TRUE. We may disclose your photo identification document or certain personal information you provide to our third-party service providers to detect inaccurate or fraudulent personal identification documents and related information. By submitting a TruYou application, you must read and accept Onfido's <a href="https://onfido.com/facial-scan-policy-and-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><u >Facial Scan Policy and Release</u></a>, <a href="https://onfido.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><u >Onfido Privacy Policy</u></a> and <a href="https://onfido.com/terms-of-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><u >Onfido Terms of Service</u></a>.</p>

<p>The TruYou badge indicates only that a user has provided SurfGenie with the requested documentation. THE TRUYOU BADGE DOES NOT DESIGNATE, AND WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT, (A) WE HAVE VERIFIED THAT A USER WITH A TRUYOU BADGE IS THE PERSON THAT THEY CLAIM TO BE, (B) THAT A USER IS IN FACT THE PERSON IDENTIFIED IN ANY PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENT THAT USER HAS PROVIDED TO US, OR (C) THAT WE HAVE TAKEN ANY STEPS TO RUN A CRIMINAL OR OTHER BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHERWISE MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF A USER'S INTEGRITY OR CHARACTER.</p>

<h3 id="dispute-resolution-binding-arbitration" >21. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration</h3>

<p>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with SurfGenie and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</p>

<p>No Representative Actions. You and SurfGenie agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and SurfGenie, and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. The limitations imposed by this section apply to, but are in no way limited to, class action refund claims brought by a class of taxpayers against SurfGenie related to taxes collected and remitted in good faith efforts at compliance with state and local marketplace facilitator or marketplace provider laws. Nothing in this section will be construed to prohibit a buyer from filing a refund claim with the seller or applicable state and local tax authority as permitted by law.</p>

<p>Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or SurfGenie seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or SurfGenie seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and SurfGenie waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against SurfGenie or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact SurfGenie and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim ("<em>Notice</em>") to SurfGenie by email at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:admin@surfgenie.com" >admin@surfgenie.com</a> or by certified mail addressed to SurfGenie Inc., Attn: SurfGenie Designated Agent, 1100 Bellevue Way NE, Suite 8(A), #57, Bellevue, Washington 98004.</p>

<p>The Notice must (a) include your name, your residence address, your email address, your telephone number, and, if you have registered for an SurfGenie account, the email address your account is registered under if it is different from your current email address; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and SurfGenie cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in King County, Washington unless you are a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration at the JAMS office closest to your residence. For purposes of this Section 21, a "<em>consumer</em>" means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. Additionally, arbitrations may be conducted telephonically or via video conference for disputes alleging damages less than $10,000. You and SurfGenie agree that arbitrations will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("<em>JAMS Rules</em>"). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><u >JAMS website</u></a> and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>

<p>You and SurfGenie agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 21 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, <em>et seq</em>. (the "<em>FAA</em>"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine whether a dispute may be arbitrated. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

<p>The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute. The arbitrator, SurfGenie, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>

<p>You and SurfGenie agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and SurfGenie will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by SurfGenie, SurfGenie will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and SurfGenie agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Washington and the United States sitting in King County, Washington have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>

<p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and SurfGenie will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>

<p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 21 by emailing SurfGenie at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:admin@surfgenie.com" >admin@surfgenie.com</a>.</p>

<p>In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 23.</p>

<p>If any portion of this Section 21 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 21 or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 21; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 21 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 21 will be enforceable. If you are a consumer, the provisions of this Section 21 will be modified to the extent necessary to conform to the JAMS <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards</a>.</p>
