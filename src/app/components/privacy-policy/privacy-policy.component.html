<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Last updated: Apr 26, 2022</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by SurfGenie, Inc. (hereafter "SurfGenie", "our", "we", or "us"). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website, mobile applications and other online services (collectively, the "SurfGenie Service") or when you otherwise interact with us.</p>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with more prominent notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the SurfGenie Service to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>

<p>Note: SurfGenie is piloting a new electronic payments solution that is only available to certain users. As a result, some of the provisions of this privacy policy related to the payments solution may not apply to all users.</p>

<p>If you are a California resident, please see the "<a  rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://SurfGenie.com/privacy#information-for-california-residents" >Information for California Consumers</a>" section below.</p>

<h3>3. Information from Third Parties.</h3>

<p>SurfGenie may, from time to time, obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the SurfGenie Service in order to enhance our ability to serve you, prevent fraudulent transactions, tailor our content to you, offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and for any other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

<h3>14. Information for California Residents.</h3>

<p>This section provides additional disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which applies to the personal information we collect about California residents.</p>

<p>In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers (such as name, contact information, device identifiers and state-issued ID numbers); internet or other electronic network activity information (such as usage data); demographic information (such as age); commercial information (such as products purchased or sold); geolocation data; inferences (such as approximate location); visual or similar information (such as photographs of yourself); and other information that relates to or is reasonably capable of being associated with you and that does not fit neatly into one of the other categories (such as personal information contained in reviews, comments and communications with us). For more details about the personal information we collect, including the categories of sources, please see the <a  rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://SurfGenie.com/privacy#collection-of-information" >Collection of Information</a> section above.</p>

<p>We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes listed in the <a  rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://SurfGenie.com/privacy#use-of-information" >Use of Information</a> section above. We share the personal information we collect with the categories of third parties listed in the <a rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://SurfGenie.com/privacy#sharing-of-information" >Sharing of Information</a> section above.</p>

<p>Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California residents with the right to:</p>

<ul>
<li>request to know about the personal information that we have collected about you in the 12 months preceding your request (including the categories of information collected, the source of that information, the business purpose of that collection, the categories of third parties with whom that information is shared, and the specific pieces of personal information collected about you);</li>
<li>request to delete any personal information about you that we have collected;</li>
<li>opt-out of "sales" of personal information to third parties, if applicable; and</li>
<li>not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights.</li>
</ul>

<p>CCPA requires that we provide transparency about personal information we "sell", which is broadly defined. While we don’t share personal information in exchange for money, we do allow Google’s online advertising service to collect identifiers (such as cookies and other device identifiers) and internet or other electronic network information (such as the webpage you visited) through the SurfGenie Service for the purpose of sending personalized ads to you. This activity may be considered a "sale" under California law. To opt out of this "sale", please visit our <a href="https://about.SurfGenie.com/donotsell" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a> page. We do not knowingly sell personal information about consumers under the age of 16.</p>

<p>To submit a request to know or a request to delete, please send an email to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:admin@surfgenie.com" target="_blank" >admin@surfgenie.com</a>. In both cases, we will verify your request by asking you to provide information that matches information we have on file about you. You may designate another person as your authorized agent to act on your behalf with regard to CCPA requests. If you have designated an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf, we will require proof that the person is authorized to act on your behalf and may also still ask you to verify your identity with us directly.</p>


<h3 id="questions-and-comments" >Questions and Comments.</h3>
